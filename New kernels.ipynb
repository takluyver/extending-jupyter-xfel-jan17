    "A kernel is the part that understands and executes code in a particular language. The default kernel which comes with Jupyter is IPython, for Python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other kernels include [IJulia](https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl), for the Julia language, and [JupyROOT](https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/master/bindings/pyroot/JupyROOT) for CERN's *ROOT* data analysis environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Many other kernels](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/Jupyter-kernels) have been written. Their quality varies considerably, but if you want to run a language in Jupyter, see what's already there before writing a new one.\n",
    "\n",
    "If there's no kernel for the language you want, or you're creating a new language or dialect, you can write your own kernel to access it from Jupyter."
